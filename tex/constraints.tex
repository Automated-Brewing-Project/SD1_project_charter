The following list contains key constraints related to the implementation and testing of the project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Final prototype demonstration must be completed by August 1st, 2021 
  \item The entire brewing process can not be shown at the Summer 2021 Senior Design Presentations because brewing takes a certain time to produce beer. 
  \item Total development costs must not exceed \$800 
  \item Social distancing requires virtual meetings which lead to a limitation on a tasting of the final product from brewing equipment. 
  \item Extra searching and studying time is required since a lack of hardware-related experiences.
\end{itemize}
