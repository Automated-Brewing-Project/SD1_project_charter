Who are the stakeholders of the project? Who will be the point of contact from the sponsor or customer side? Who are the team members, and what will be their areas of responsibility? Will your team maintain the product owner and scrum master for the whole project, or will that role change periodically? This section should occupy 1/2 - 1 full page.


The stakeholders are the members of this team, Chris Conly, and the CSE Department. The main point of contact will be our mentor Chris Conly.
