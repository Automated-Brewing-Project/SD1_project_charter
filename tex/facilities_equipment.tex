Because we are currently facing an unusual situation in the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be conducting lab experiments and building equipment at a place where not many people present. Facilities can be either home or UTA CSE Senior Design lab. 

Facilities has to have enough space to work on equipment, a power supply, and a table with a flat surface. Requirements for the facilities will be either leased or already present in the lab. 

Required materials for this project are four containers; one for a hot liquor tank, the other for a mash tun, one for a storage kettle, and lastly a fermentation kettle. Three pumps will be used to push the liquid in tanks to other tanks when the environment in tanks meets a certain condition. A heater is used in the hot liquor tank to keep the water at a certain temperature. A coil gets water from the mash tun when the temperate of the water in the mash tun drops below the targeted temperature and heats up the water for a certain temperature. A thermometer reading water temperature in a hot liquor tank, a timer for brewing time, and relays controlling the heater, pumps, and reading temperature sensor will be purchased or borrowed from UTA. 

An application and a website will be created to provide an interface between users and the brewing system. Online database, the domain name for the website will be purchased.
