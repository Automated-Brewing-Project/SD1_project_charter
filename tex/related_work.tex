Discuss the state-of-the-art with respect to your product. What solutions currently exist, and in what form (academic research, enthusiast prototype, commercially available, etc.)? Include references and citations as necessary using the \textit{cite} command, like this \cite{Rubin2012}. If there are existing solutions, why won't they work for your customer (too expensive, not fast enough, not reliable enough, etc.). This section should occupy 1/2 - 1 full page, and should include at least 5 references to related work. All references should be added to the \textit{.bib} file, fully documented in IEEE format, and should appear in the \textit{references} section at the end of this document (the IEEE citation style will automatically be applied if your reference is properly added to the \textit{.bib} file).

ProTip: Consider using a citation manager such as Mendeley, Zotero, or EndNote to generate your \textit{.bib} file and maintain documentation references throughout the life cycle of the project.

BrewPI Spark - commercially available - $900~

There are a few options available, but it depends on how much you'd like to pay. On the more budget end, the BrewPI is a DIY kit that you could put together. You have to buy all the parts seperately, but they are all available off of one website. The BrewPI Spark is capable of controlling the temperature of a "hacked" fridge, the temperature of the heater inside of the fridge, and it monitors the temperature of the beer itself. The BrewPI Spark then communicates with another Raspberry PI that runs a web server that can be viewed on a computer or phone. It does not have mash temperature control or a way to control pumps or valves.
